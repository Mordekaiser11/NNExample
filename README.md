# NNExample

This is an example for creating a basic model in Keras.

My aim is to strengthen my theorical information about neural networks and to understand better how it works.

This can be done by anyone because it is an easy level project.

I added txt file version of csv file.

Code basically handles set and create a model and then fits.

Logic is simple so i do not need to make it too complex....
